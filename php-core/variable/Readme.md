## 3. Variables

In PHP, a variable is a symbolic name or identifier that represents a value stored in computer memory. It is used to store and manipulate data within a PHP script. Variables can hold various types of data, such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and more.

In PHP, variables are declared using the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name. The name can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but it must start with a letter or an underscore. PHP is a loosely typed language, which means you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it.

Variables in PHP are dynamic, meaning their values can change throughout the execution of a script. You can assign new values to variables or modify their existing values using assignment operators or various PHP functions and operations.

Variables in PHP are used to store data and enable developers to perform operations and manipulate the data within their scripts. They provide flexibility and help in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
