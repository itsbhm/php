### 5. Control structures

In PHP, control structures are used to control the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions or criteria. There are several control structures available in PHP:

1. **if statement:** It allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

```php
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

> Refer [if-statement.php](https://github.com/itsbhm/php/blob/master/php-core/control-structures/if-statement.php) for code blocks.


2. **if-else statement:** It allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

```php
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```
