# PHP Core

## 1. Introduction


PHP stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor." It is a widely used scripting language that is primarily used for web development. PHP is an open-source language, which means it is free to use and can be modified by developers.

PHP is mainly used on the server-side, meaning it runs on the web server and generates dynamic web pages. It is often embedded within HTML code and executed on the server before the resulting web page is sent to the client's browser.

PHP offers a range of functionalities that are useful for web development, such as database connectivity, session management, form processing, and file manipulation. It is compatible with various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, allowing developers to interact with data efficiently.

One of the key advantages of PHP is its ease of use and versatility. It has a simple and readable syntax that is similar to C and Perl, making it accessible for beginners while also providing advanced features for more experienced developers. PHP is supported by a large and active community, which contributes to its extensive library of pre-built functions and frameworks, enabling developers to build web applications quickly.

Overall, PHP is a popular choice for web development due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive community support. It powers a significant portion of websites on the internet, ranging from small personal blogs to large-scale e-commerce platforms.
